There are multiple ways to list all the packages installed on Manjaro. Here are a few methods:

1. Using pacman:

```
pacman -Qe
```

This command will list all the packages explicitly installed using pacman.

2. Using pamac:

```
pamac list
```

This command will list all the packages installed on the system, including packages installed using other package managers or manually.

3. Using yay:

```
yay -Qe
```

This command will list all the packages explicitly installed using yay.

To mass uninstall packages, you can use pacman or pamac. Here are the commands:

1. Using pacman:

```
sudo pacman -Rs package1 package2 package3 ...
```

This command will remove the specified packages and their dependencies.

2. Using pamac:

```
sudo pamac remove package1 package2 package3 ...
```

This command will remove the specified packages and their dependencies. It also supports removing packages from AUR (Arch User Repository).
In Manjaro Linux, there are multiple commands to remove packages and their dependencies. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. `pacman -R`: This removes the specified package and its configuration files.

   Example: `sudo pacman -R package_name`

2. `pacman -Rs`: This removes the specified package along with its dependencies which are not required by any other package. It also removes their configuration files.

   Example: `sudo pacman -Rs package_name`

3. `pacman -Rn`: This removes the specified package and its configuration files, as well as any dependencies that are not required by other packages.

   Example: `sudo pacman -Rn package_name`

4. `pacman -Rns`: This removes the specified package, its configuration files, and any dependencies that are not required by other packages. It also removes all packages that were installed as dependencies of the package being removed.

   Example: `sudo pacman -Rns package_name`

To mass uninstall packages, you can use the `pacman -R` or `pacman -Rs` command followed by a list of package names separated by spaces.

Example: `sudo pacman -Rs package1 package2 package3`

Note that removing packages and their dependencies can break other applications that rely on them. It is generally recommended to only remove packages that are no longer needed or causing issues, and to proceed with caution.
- The `pacman` command is the default package manager for Arch Linux and its derivatives like Manjaro. The `-Q` option is used to query the local package database, while the `-e` option is used to list explicitly installed packages.

- Therefore, the command `pacman -Qe` will list all packages that have been explicitly installed on the system.

- On the other hand, `pamac` is a graphical frontend for package management on Manjaro. `pamac list` is a command used in the terminal to list all the installed packages using the `pamac` package manager.

- While both `pacman` and `pamac` are package managers, they are not the same thing. `pacman` is a command-line tool, whereas `pamac` provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing packages.
To remove a specified package and its configuration files along with its dependencies which are not required by any other package, you can use the `pacman -Rs` command. This command will remove the package along with its dependencies that are not required by any other package. The `-s` option is used to remove the package along with its configuration files.

To remove the specified packages and their configuration files in a safe and efficient manner that they don't break any other installed program on the system, you can use the `pacman -Rns` command. This command will remove the package along with its configuration files and any unneeded dependencies that were installed with it.

The `-n` option is used to remove packages that are not required by any other package, and the `-s` option is used to remove the package along with its configuration files. It's important to note that this command will only remove unneeded dependencies that were installed with the specified package and not any other dependencies that may be needed by other installed packages.

Overall, using the `pacman -Rns` command is a safe and efficient way to remove specified packages and their configuration files without breaking any other installed program on the system.
