To view a markdown file on GitHub in a browser, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository that contains the markdown file you want to view.

2. Locate the markdown file in the file tree and click on it to open it.

3. Once the markdown file is open, click on the "Raw" button at the top right of the page. This will open the raw version of the file in the browser.

4. Copy the URL of the raw file from the browser's address bar.

5. Go to a markdown viewer website like https://dillinger.io/ or https://markdownlivepreview.com/ .

6. Paste the raw file URL into the viewer's text box and click "Preview" or "Render" to view the formatted markdown file in the browser.

Alternatively, you can also use a browser extension like "Markdown Viewer" for Chrome or "Markdown Viewer Webext" for Firefox to view markdown files on GitHub directly in your browser.
