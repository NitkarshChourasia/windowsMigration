In PowerShell on Windows 10, the active Python virtual environment is typically indicated by the virtual environment's name in parentheses before the command prompt. However, if you don't see the virtual environment name displayed, there are a few possible reasons:

1. Activate the virtual environment: Make sure you have successfully activated the virtual environment by running the `activate.bat` script. In your case, you mentioned running `/dir1/Scripts/activate.bat`. Ensure that the path is correct, and the activation command is executed without any errors.

2. Check PowerShell prompt customization: It's possible that your PowerShell prompt is customized and doesn't include the virtual environment name by default. In some cases, customizations can remove or modify the display of the virtual environment. You can try using a different PowerShell prompt configuration or modify the existing one to include the virtual environment name.

3. Virtual environment naming convention: Verify the naming convention of your virtual environments. By convention, the virtual environment name is often displayed in the format `(env_name)` before the command prompt. If your virtual environment is not following this convention, the name might not be displayed.

4. PowerShell version and configuration: Ensure that you are using a version of PowerShell that supports the display of virtual environment names. Older versions of PowerShell may not show the virtual environment name by default. You can check your PowerShell version by running the command `Get-Host | Select-Object Version`.

5. Use PowerShell prompt module: Alternatively, you can use a PowerShell prompt module like `PSReadLine` or `Oh-My-Posh`, which provide enhanced prompt customization options. These modules can be configured to display the virtual environment name along with other useful information in the prompt.

By addressing these points, you should be able to determine why the virtual environment name is not displayed in your PowerShell prompt and take the necessary steps to resolve the issue.
