Yes, there is a way to avoid the password prompt entirely by using an authentication method that doesn't require entering your password each time. One such method is by using SSH keys. 

Here's how you can set up SSH keys and configure Git to use them for authentication:

1. Generate SSH keys:
   - Open your preferred terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair:
     ```
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
     Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your email address associated with your GitHub account.
   - You will be prompted to provide a file path to save the SSH key pair. Press Enter to accept the default path, or specify a custom path if desired.
   - You may be prompted to enter a passphrase. It's recommended to use a passphrase for added security, but you can leave it blank if you prefer.

2. Add your SSH key to GitHub:
   - Copy the public key to your clipboard by running the following command:
     ```
     clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
     If the `clip` command doesn't work, you can manually open the `id_ed25519.pub` file and copy its contents.
   - Go to your GitHub account settings and navigate to the "SSH and GPG keys" section.
   - Click on "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key."
   - Provide a title for the key (e.g., "My SSH Key") and paste the public key into the "Key" field.
   - Click "Add SSH key" to save the key to your GitHub account.

3. Configure Git to use SSH:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to configure Git to use SSH:
     ```
     git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
     ```

With these steps completed, Git will use your SSH keys for authentication, eliminating the need to enter a password when pushing or committing signed commits.

Note: If you already have existing SSH keys, you can skip the key generation step and use your existing keys instead. Just make sure to add the appropriate public key to your GitHub account.
